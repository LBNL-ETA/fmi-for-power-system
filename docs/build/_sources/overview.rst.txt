Overview
========

CyDER is a modular and scalable tool for power system planning and operation that will work seamlessly with existing interconnection planning tools in the utilities and be interoperable with future utility software, data streams, and controls. CyDER will maintain and enhance the efficiency and reliability of the power system in a cost-effective and safe manner, being built on three pillars: quasi-static time series (QSTS) co-simulation and optimization, real-time data acquisition, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) application.
