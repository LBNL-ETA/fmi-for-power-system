11/21/2018 04:45:17 PM FMI version not specified. Version 2.0 will be used.
11/21/2018 04:45:17 PM No configuration file was provided. JModelica does not allow to set the path to a configuration file at runtime. Hence if the exported simulation program/script needs a configuration file to run, then the path to the configuration file must be provided when creating the FMU. Otherwise the FMU will fail to run.
