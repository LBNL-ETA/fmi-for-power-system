12/04/2018 11:29:34 AM FMI version not specified. Version 2.0 will be used.
12/04/2018 11:29:34 AM No configuration file was provided. JModelica does not allow to set the path to a configuration file at runtime. Hence if the exported simulation program/script needs a configuration file to run, then the path to the configuration file must be provided when creating the FMU. Otherwise the FMU will fail to run.
